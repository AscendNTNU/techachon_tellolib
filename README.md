# Techathon Tello Challenge

This repository contains libraries and sample code for the first task of the 2019 Techathon: The physical challenge.

Your objective in the physical drone challenge is to maneuver a Ryze Tello drone around a windmill and take photos from all four directions,
before returning  and landing.

To get you flying as quickly as possible, we have provided a Python library for interfacing with the drone in the same way you will be doing in the
simulator challenges.  

Happy flying, and remember to have fun!
